# Code Samples

Just a small sample of code from a recent REACT project

- App.tsx – Main application logic and UI
- authProvider.ts – Authentication provider implementation
- lib.ts – Likely shared library with reusable code
- types.ts – TypeScript type definitions
- main.tsx – App entry point
- Components/ – Contains UI components (details not listed by the API, but likely valuable)
- CHANGELOG.md, App.css, index.css, vite-env.d.ts – Supporting docs and styles
